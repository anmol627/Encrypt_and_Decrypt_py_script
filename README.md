## 📝 Description
This is a simple encryption and decryption script written in Python. It randomizes a list of ASCII characters, so every time you run the program, the letters and their ASCII equivalents will change. This makes your messages secure and protects your sensitive information.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to download and run the script.

### 📦 Requirements
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Python version 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 💡 How to Use
- **Encryption:** To encrypt a message, simply input the text you want to secure. Press Enter. The program will generate a randomized string representing your message.
- **Decryption:** To decrypt, input the encrypted string. Press Enter. The original message will reveal itself.

### 🛠 Features
- Randomizes ASCII characters for enhanced security.
- Simple text input for easy use.
- Implements both encryption and decryption in one script.

### 📖 Example
1. **Encryption:**
   - Input: "Hello, World!"
   - Output: "3u$J@2^"

2. **Decryption:**
   - Input: "3u$J@2^"
   - Output: "Hello, World!"

### 🐞 Troubleshooting
